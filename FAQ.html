    <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>What is a CTF?</h3>
      CTFs, short for capture-the-flag competitions, are a type of online programming and cybersecurity competition in which participants solve computer science problems to earn points. Each problem is “solved” by finding its hidden flag, a string of text that looks something like <span class="differentFont">pekoe{sample_flag_123abc}</span>. Problems are assigned different point values based on their difficulty: while many people familiar with computers may be able to solve a 50-point problem, only the truly skilled will be able to find the flag of a 500-point problem.

      <h3>How do I participate in PekoeCTF?</h3>
      Once you’ve registered and signed in, go to the “Challenges” page, and click a problem you’d like to try your hand at. You’ll receive a description, a hint, and any files that the problem might have you interacting with. Note that you will never be penalized for looking at the hint; in fact, it’s expected that you do. Clues might be hidden in the problem’s name, description, and/or hint. Once you’ve figured out what to do and solved the problem, you’ll get a flag, a string of text that looks something like <span class="differentFont">pekoe{sample_flag_123abc}</span>. Input this flag into the problem and click submit. If you got it right, congratulations! You’ll be awarded your points. If not, feel free to take another swing at it: there is no penalty for a wrong answer.
